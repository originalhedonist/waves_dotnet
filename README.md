# waves_dotnet

## To just run from the command line:

Download dotnet from here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download

(Click 'Download .NET Core Runtime' and then install it)

Then:
```
git clone https://github.com/originalhedonist/waves_dotnet
cd waves_dotnet
wavegenerator.bat
```

To avoid having to enter all the parameters all the time:
Once you have created a file, you can tweak the parameters and then pass that file on the command line to the program a subsequent time, and it will use the same parameters again.
For any parameters you DO want to be prompted for, just delete those lines from the file.


## To develop using Visual Studio:

* Download any version of Visual Studio from Microsoft
* Open wavegenerator.sln
* Edit code as you like
* Press F5 to run
* Submit pull request? (If you've added anything interesting!)
